  <h1 id="top"><u>House Cow</u></h1>


  <p> A house cow is a cow kept to provide milk for a home kitchen.This differentiates them from dairy cows, which are
    farmed commercially. They can also provide manure, for use as a garden fertilizer,and their offspring can be a
    source of meat.
    <br>
    House cows are used in locations, usually rural, without convenient access to a supply of commercial dairy
    products.They can also be kept for household self-sufficiency and a preference for organically farmed food.

    In England, during the 18th century, families would take their house cow, and other livestock, to graze on the local
    common land.In the 1770s, before common land began to be enclosed as private land, it was estimated that even a
    'poor' house cow, 'providing a gallon of milk per day' was worth, in the milking season, 'half the equivalent of a
    labourer's annual wage' to a family.<br>
    In 1910, during the United States' Presidency of William Howard Taft, Senator Isaac Stephenson had a house cow
    called 'Pauline Wayne', a Holstein Friesian,sent from his Wisconsin farm to the White House to provide fresh milk
    for the first family.After arrival she 'grazed contentedly upon the White House lot, oblivious to the general fuss
    being made'.
    <br>
    In Australia, house cows were still common enough for the New South Wales government to issue a free booklet on
    their management and care in 1953.<br>
    In the 19th century, Breton cattle, from Brittany, France, were imported into England and promoted as an ideal house
    cow breed because of their docile nature and small size.
    <br>
    Shetland cattle, from the Shetland Isles, off the north coast of Scotland, are a small, hardy cattle breed, which,
    until recent times, were traditionally milked three times a day—morning, twall (midday) and night—to produce the
    maximum amount of milk, which could be more than three gallons.
    <br>
    The Dexter cattle breed, which originated in southwestern Ireland, is small, easy-to-keep and suited for milk and
    meat, is known as 'the poor man's house cow'.
